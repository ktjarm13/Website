        <h2>How It Started</h2>
        <p>There’s a particular scene in Season 5 of Bojack Horseman (slight spoilers ahead but nothing major) that has deeply wounded me several times. The whole show is such a deep dive into mental health issues that it remains on the “watch alone list” of our Trello TV and Movie board (yes we have one of these).</p>
        <p>Mr Peanutbutter (my least favourite character) is reviewing his several failed relationships culminating in him asking himself “what’s the common factor?” The joke is that we as the audience know that he is the common factor but at this point he’s too self involved to see that.</p>
        <p>As I sat, sobbing with a mix of rage and upset at yet another conversation with yet another employer that I was struggling to gel with, I knew that I would have to quit.</p>
        <p>“How could this keep happening?” I asked myself “I keep getting these jobs that seem awesome but I soon get so bored and overwhelmed that I struggle to function. What’s the common factor?”</p>
        <p>“Ouch” said another part of my brain who had answered the question before it had been asked. “It’s me. I’m the common factor.”</p>
        <p>It’s incredibly hard to realise and admit that we might be at the core of a problem we’re having without immediately making that some kind of horrendous moral failing. And the realisation that my second career might not actually be right for me was tough. How could I have been so stupid? Why was I so incapable of sticking to something? Was I lazy? Too privileged? Was I expecting something (job satisfaction) that didn’t exist? The most surprising thing for me was not only that these questions actually did have answers but that those answers would come from TikTok.</p>
        <p>There’s a great video of me on what must be my 4th or 5th Christmas where I’m playing with a Disney Lion King playset. I’m using this playset to retell the story of the Lion King, word for word. When my parents interrupt me and try to get me to pay attention to my other presents I sigh and start the story again. This was just one of the many things that got me diagnosed with autism when I was in my early 20s. But, the specialist said, I was clearly ‘high functioning’ and so it didn’t really matter. I decided they were the professional and so they must be right.</p>
        <p>I just continued with my life, occasionally spiralling further into depression. Then I started watching TikTok. I found myself on autism TikTok. I saw other afab individuals, who seemed to be like myself talking about things I hadn’t even realised weren’t ‘normal’. Had I been accidentally triggering myself and causing my own autistic meltdowns for years? I’ve always loved a challenge, I can hardly bear it when my brain isn’t being pushed to its limits. The enjoyment I got from that was everything. I got that same buzz from my current career. But it wasn’t quite the same buzz…rather than challenging my brain to do something it could do that was difficult, I was challenging my brain by forcing it to do something it simply wasn’t built to do.</p>
        <p>I couldn’t keep doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results — I wasn’t that brand of crazy. I thought about the bits I’d liked most in previous roles and started reading more into data engineering. And so this Monday I’ll be starting a bootcamp to retrain as a data engineer. I’m excited and terrified. I turn 30 this year and I’m basically starting a career from scratch. But how wonderful is that? I never want to stop learning.</p>
        <p>I’m going to use this space to talk about what it’s like to retrain, in your late twenties, to an entirely new career — especially one so dominated by men. Please feel free to join me on this journey! Ask me any questions you like, and please give me any advice or tips that you think might help me. I never want to stop learning.</p>
